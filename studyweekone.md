# Study Week one

This week was a focus on AP test prep. Even though I am not taking the AP Exam, the extra preperation is helping me prepare for real world coding/engineering situations as I am still unsure about my career pathway. I chose to watch two AP CB lecture videos to help me gain a better understanding on primitive data types and arrays vs arraylists. Here is are the notes I took: http://p1-valid.me/personaltech/lectures


## Coding Plan 

After meeting up with our sponsor, Mr. E, on Thursday, we discussed the color scheme and what he wants to prioritize in the project. Since he told us he uses Linkedin often, we though the best way to utilize this project is to connect students through their accomlishments and clubs they are part of so they can make connections. Some things/features we talked about including are:
- messaging
- calender with school sports events
- ASB announcement channel 
- ability to easily change profile page 
- a page that shows how to change up profile (probably hard code it)

Week of 4/18
- meet with Mr. E
- change up nav bar
- begin discussing back end work with Crystal 
- organize a template for all the pages
